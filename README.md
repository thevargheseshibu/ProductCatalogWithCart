# ProductCatalogWithCart
=======
Project Name: Product Catalog with cart
Overview
The goal of this task is to create a Product catalog interface with cart feature. Create an application by
the following steps:
1. Create your own JSON data for multiple product details. Create another JSON file to maintain
inventory for all available products.
2. Create component to list the products on the page with details. There should be two different
layouts to list the products on the page. i.e. Table view and Grid view. Add a switch to change
between these two.
3. It should show add to cart button for each product and user should be able to add same
product multiple times.
4. Different products could have limited purchase quantity. e.g. 2 per order only. (limit should be
different per item)
5. User should see a warning per product if there are only few items left in inventory. And can
not add more items than inventory count.
6. Upon adding/removing items from cart, cart should update # of items and total purchase
value. 
7. User preference for layout and cart details should be persisted so user could see the same
state after refresh. 
Note: NO need to create separate component/route to show product details.
Additional tasks (Perform any one of below)
1. Add button to compare products and create a component to show the comparison if multiple
items are selected (Maximum 3). Also, user should be able to remove item from comparison.
2. Products can have variants e.g. Mobile phone with 6GB variant or 8GB. Product detail
component should have multiple buttons for different variations and details should be updated
based on that. Adding that to card should also be updated to use different value for different
variant. Also add a feature to apply discount coupon on card value. (Use different JSON file
with coupon codes and respective discount percentage) 

This is an open-ended task with no specific design, where the choices regarding presentation and
user interaction are left to the developer.
Technologies
You can use any framework or library of your choice.
You can use transpilers and preprocessors if preferred.
The result is expected to be a package containing HTML, CSS, JS and any pre-compiled sources.
Ideally the package will include a built version of the application that requires no building steps to run.
The resulting application shouldn’t require any server side code (JAVA, PHP, nodeJS, etc)

Outcomes
Upon submitting the code we’ll be looking at the overall result of your work, including but not
limited to:
 Ensuring the code executes and the displayed data is accurate

 The presentation and user experience
 Clarity and consistency of the code
 Coding patterns and best practices
 Technologies used
 Present your solution and code to interview panel and explain it in brief
 Also present the improvement areas/ideas to interview panel







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
